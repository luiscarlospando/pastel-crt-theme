# Pastel CRT Theme for Warp terminal
![Screenshot of CRT Pastel Warp terminal theme](./screenshots/screenshot-pastel-crt.png)

Custom made theme for Warp terminal that emulates the look of an old CRT display and combines it with a beautiful combination of pastel colors.

## Installation

### Create the themes directory for Warp in case you don't have it (skippable step)
Of course, if you already have this folder created, you can skip this step.

```git
mkdir -p ~/.warp
cd ~/.warp/
git clone https://github.com/warpdotdev/themes.git
```

### Clone this repo into your themes directory
If you cloned the repo above, there will be a list of directories inside it. I would choose to clone this repo into the `special_edition` directory, but ultimately, that is completely up to you!

```git
cd ~/.warp/themes
git clone https://github.com/luiscarlospando/crt-pastel-theme.git
```

### That's it!
Now you only have to restart Warp terminal, go to the theme selection menu and search for `CRT Pastel` to select this theme.

Enjoy. ‚úåÔ∏è

## Dependencies
Of course you will need to have Warp terminal in order to use this theme.
